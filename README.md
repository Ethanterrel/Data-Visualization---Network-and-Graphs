# Data-Visualization---Network and Graphs---Ethan-Lewis
Data Visualization Project 2


A graph (or network visualization) is used to represent relationships between entities. To create a graph, you need to generate a layout that maps an X, Y position for each entity (node) and then connects the nodes based on their relationships to each other (links) as shown in this Visualization.
